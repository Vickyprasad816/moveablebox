#Moveable-box

In the application, the user controls the position of a box inside a container using four directional buttons (left, right, top, and bottom). I have implemented a crucial feature that automatically disables the buttons when the box's border touches the corresponding border of the container. This ensures that the box remains within the container's limits and enhances the user experience by preventing them from moving the box outside the boundaries of the container. Overall, this functionality guarantees that users can control the box within the defined limits of the container.
